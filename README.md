# The Rangers Manager Simulator

Currently hosted [here](https://scottish-football-simulators.co.uk/rangers).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [React Routers](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

## About

I made this game in React JS after [making another one the year before](https://github.com/aagb1884/derek_adams_simulator).

The game is a text based Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-style football management game where you have to manage Rangers FC after their previous manager unexpectedly failed.

The game is aimed at Scottish football fans and the terminally online.

### How it works

As with the Ross County management simulator this is [based on another game's code](https://medium.com/@dimterion/making-an-interactive-text-adventure-game-with-react-779667cca2cb) with the game rewritten and redesigned. The game data is a big array of identically-structured objects with a hook to actually make the gameplay work.

### Hosting

I initially hosted the game on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which was extremely straightforward as it deploys and builds it from a Github Repo very quickly, meaning you can just push code to the repo and the webpages update. However I have sinced made [a website to host all the different Scottish Football](https://github.com/aagb1884/derek_adams_simulator) games I've built.
