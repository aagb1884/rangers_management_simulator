# The Derek Adams Management Simulator

Currently hosted [here](https://derek-adams-simulator.vercel.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [React Routers](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

## About

I made this game in React JS after reading an article about making text adventure games in React. More info about it can be found [here](https://medium.com/@dimterion/making-an-interactive-text-adventure-game-with-react-779667cca2cb).

The game is a text based Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-style football management game (specifically the 12-match reign of Derek Adams at Scottish Premiership club Ross County during the 2023-24 season) with references to Football Manager and a surprising amount of medieval Welsh manuscripts.

The game is aimed at Scottish football fans and the terminally online.

### Fallout

I hosted the game on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which was extremely straightforward as it deploys and builds it from a Github Repo very quickly, meaning you can just push code to the repo and the webpages update. However it exceeded the free tier bandwidth on day one! As a result I have been a bit rushed today in moving it to a paid tier and looking at options going forward.
